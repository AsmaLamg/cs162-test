# Whimsical Bio!

Hi! My name is **Chloe**, and I love three things: **authenticity, compassion, and code**! That’s why Minerva is perfect for me :) I was born in New York City and grew up in Toronto, Canada my whole life. I think it would be easiest to get to know me ***by saying what my favourite thing about each rotation city is*** (other than the **people** who travel with me to each one <3), so here goes nothing:
    * **San Francisco:** Sunsets! I lived at Embarcadero for those ocean sunset views :sun_with_face:
    * **Seoul:** Café study dates! I’m always down for a work sesh where we get to know each other during the breaks :computer:
    * **Berlin:** Hockey games! In classic Canadian fashion, I went to a few of the Ice Bears' energetic, hilarious, and super crazy games :snowflake: :bear:

**Thanks for stopping by!** :smile: :sparkles:
