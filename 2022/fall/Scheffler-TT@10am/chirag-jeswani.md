I was always the quite/shy kid when growing up, but today I talk a lot!
I aspire to become a **Software Engineer** however, I am not too sure what I want to do.
What are my options-:
1. Data Science
2. Web Development
3. Android Development

Why do I want to do it-:
- Problem-solving is fun
- ~Money~
- Gives an opportunity to create new stuff and help people

At the end, I would like to extend a tribute to a fictional tech bro from the TV show Silicon Valley-:
>I don't want to live in a world where someone else is making the world a better place than we are.
