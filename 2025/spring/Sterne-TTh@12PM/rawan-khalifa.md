## Hey I'm Rawan 

I'm from **Egypt** yet I'd called other *4* countries home in the last *Three Years*.
I'm currently in Argentina, immersing herself in local culture while mastering Spanish.

I found this quote truly inspiring to me:
> "Bliss cannot be attained through ease." -Imam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya

I stumbled upon the quote in a period of my life I chose comfort over effort. That's when I paused and thought to myself: I shouldn’t expect more if I’m not willing to do more!

I find the applications of ***Machine Learning and Deep Learning*** extremely inspiring especially in Generative tasks. I have built a Generative Model that transfers Van Gogh Style to your landscape imgages! Check out this [Repository](https://github.com/Rawan-Khalifa/style_transfer_van_gogh) and try it out!

## Thank you for taking the time to read those scattered facts!
