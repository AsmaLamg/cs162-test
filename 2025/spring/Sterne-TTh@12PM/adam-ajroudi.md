# My Journey

Born under the Tunisian sun in **Nabeul**, I carry the warmth of my homeland with me in the rotation cities of **Minerva University**. My childhood, spent amidst the cultural center **Neapolis**, instilled in me a deep appreciation for history, culture, and art.

While my path may not always be linear, I approach life with a quiet curiosity and a determination to make a difference. This led me to study **software engineering**. I love exchange programs and aim to bring the world closer and make people more tolerant and curious about cultures through technological solutions.
