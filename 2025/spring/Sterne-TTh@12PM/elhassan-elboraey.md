# Hello! I'm Alhassan Ahmed 👋

Born and raised in **Egypt**, I’ve had the privilege of calling *3* other countries home over the last few years. These experiences have shaped my worldview and fueled my passion for connecting across cultures. Currently, I’m in the **United States**, diving into new challenges and embracing the diversity around me.

### A Quote That Speaks to Me  
**"وتشاءُ أنت من البشائر قطرةً  
ويشاءُ ربُك أن يُغيثك بالمطر."**

**Translation:**  
*"You may long for a single drop of glad tidings,  
but your Lord has decreed a downpour of blessings."*

This verse beautifully captures the generosity of divine will, reminding me that life often holds far greater gifts than I dare to imagine. It inspires me to trust in the unseen and find solace in patience.

### My Fascination with AI  
The endless potential of ***AI*** and its ability to tackle real-world problems excites me, especially when it comes to fostering human connection. One of my proudest projects is [إذاعة القرآن الكريم](https://github.com/Alhassan777/Al-quraan-Al-kareem-FM/tree/main), a platform I developed to stream Quranic radio content. The platform offers users features like recording streams and displaying audio waveforms for an enhanced listening experience. It’s my way of blending technology with spirituality to create meaningful connections.
