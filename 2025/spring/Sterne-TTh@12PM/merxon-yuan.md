**Some of my favorite things:** Game development, cooking, cycling, volleyball

I have a *personal website* introducing some of my [game development projects](https://merxonyuan.wordpress.com/).

> Guess what: I have two dogs and a cat at home. They're good friends, and they don't fight.

**Three courses I'm taking this semester:**

2. BA
3. SF

**My to-do list:**
- [x] Write this .md file

I develop games in Unity engine[^1]. Unity uses C#, and its syntax is like this:

```C#
public void PrintHelloWorld()
{
    Debug.Log("Hello World");
}
```

Different from Python, C# has this `public`, `private`, and `protected` access modifiers.

This is a screenshot from one of my game projects:
