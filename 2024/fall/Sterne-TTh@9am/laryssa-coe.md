# Hi, I'm Laryssa 🧚‍♀️

I am an M26 from **Recife, Brazil** 🇧🇷 and I am living and [trying to] thrive in **Buenos Aires, Argentina.** 🇦🇷 

I am a **Computational Science** major concentrating in *Artificial Intelligence* with a minor in Digital Practices. I have some previous experience with SWE, but I feel like there is so much more missing and to learn that I am excited for this class and also to be able to do an end-to-end group project in class. 

A quote that I really like is that: 
> "Every revolution is impossible until it becomes necessaries"

## Here are some of my passions 🫀
- 🕸️ **Jigsaw Puzzles**
- 🐬 **Free Diving**
- 🎭 **Musicals**
