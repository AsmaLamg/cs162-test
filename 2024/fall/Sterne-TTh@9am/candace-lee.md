Hi, my name is *Candace :)*
# I'm an M25 in Berlin, Germany. 

I like spacing my writing and notes so that they don't look too clustered and stuffy, however, it sometimes takes me awhile to decide how I'll format my notes for a particular piece of content. 

Although I'm not sure what _CS162_ will entail, I'm going into this class with a curious and eager mindset. 

3 cuisines you should try, according to me:
- Malaysian 
- Indian 
- Korean 

__Have a good day!__
