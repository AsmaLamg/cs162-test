## Introduction

I'm Saliqua, a senior at **Minerva University**—a student who believes that **spreadsheets** and **neural networks** are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of the universe (or at least securing a future in *Strategic Finance*). When not *dabbling in deep learning* or *optimizing investment portfolios*, I can be found sipping *cold brew* while discussing the latest developments in *AI ethics*.

## Fun Facts

1. **AI Enthusiast**:   
   Obsessed with training models to predict the future...of **stock markets**, of course.

2. **Finance Nerd**:  
   *Thinks Monte Carlo simulations* sound like a fancy casino game but is too busy running them to care.

3. **Global Nomad**:  
   In true Minerva spirit, I have called **7 cities** across **5 continents** home—collecting more boarding passes than homework assignments.

4. **Secret Skill**:  
   Fluent in **Python**, but still struggles to wrap burritos *without breaking them*.

## Hobbies & Interests

- **Trading stocks** by day, **writing Python scripts** by night.
- Avid *chess player*—currently teaching an AI to beat him so he can claim the moral high ground.
- Spends way too much time perfecting *macros in Excel*.

## Future Goals

In 5 years, I see himself leading a **fintech startup**, automating investment decisions through **AI-driven insights** while sipping artisanal coffee somewhere in a co-working space. But, if all else fails, I’ll just let his **neural network** figure out Plan B.
