Introductions are awkward, _only_ if you make them though (or so I'vr heard)

Hi, my name is Abeera. My parents named me Syeda Abeera Amir on my birth certificate, which makes it really hard to explain to people that Syeda is _not_ my name.

I like having philosophical conversations that make people uncomfortable, to filter out the good ones you know? Oh, and I want to be a writer, at some point, after or during my **successful** and **glarmorous** tech career.
