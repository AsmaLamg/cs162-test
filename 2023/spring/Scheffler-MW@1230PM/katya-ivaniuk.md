## Hey!
*I'm Katya, an M'25 student from Ukraine.* **I'm majoring in Computational Science, and am currently taking CS162, CS114, and SS110.** 
#### Before coming to Minerva, I was mainly focused on becoming a musician since I have been playing mandolin for 10 years and truly enjoyed performing. 
*However, due to some circumstances listed below I could not proceed with playing mandolin and my dream of becoming a musician*
1. Lack of time (school, exams, dancing classes)
1. Low demand on market place 
1. No conservatories that would have a good ranking, reviews.
